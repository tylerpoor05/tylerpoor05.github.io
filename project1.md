## Project description

This program was designed to replicate a d latch used to store and move information on an electrical circuit board. It acts as a temporary buffer to sends bits across a line. This code is written in verilog and programs the latch to know what to do when the bits are sent to it.

## How to run the program

The program is run using NASM to compile the verilog code. The ouput can then be seen using a IDE such as Visual Studio Code.

It would look like the following "nasm -felf64 "YourFile".v && gcc -no-pie -fPIC "YourFile".o && ./a.out
