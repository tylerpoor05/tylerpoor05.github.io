## Project description

This program is the creation of two servers. I client side server and backend server that actively communitcate to eachother of a network. The client is able to input data that is then sent over the network to the backend where it is able to seen over command line.

An example of the ouput is shown here:

As you can see, the program first starts by asking the client for a port to listen on for data to be recieved. As it asks for this port, it is important to note that the other server is running on this port ready to send the data. After the user enters in the port number, the data begins being transferred over the network until all data base been recieved.
